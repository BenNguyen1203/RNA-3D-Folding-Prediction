# RNA Knowledge:


### 1. RNA Definition
- RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a nucleic acid, a type of biological macromolecule, similar to DNA but with key differences in structure and function. It plays a crucial role in genetics and cellular biology.
- RNA is most often single-stranded. RNA molecule has a backbone made of alternating phosphate groups and the sugar ribose, attached to each sugar is one of four bases: adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), or guanine (G).
- Types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
- **A base pair** consists of two complementary DNA nucleotide bases that pair together to form a “rung of the DNA ladder.” DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble **a twisted ladder**. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases: A pairs with T (U during the protein synthesis), and C pairs with G. <br>

### 2. mRNA Definition
- mRNA is a type of RNA involved in protein synthesis. mRNA is made from a DNA template during the process of transcription. The role of mRNA is to carry protein information from the DNA in a cell's nucleus to the cell's cytoplasm (watery interior), where the protein-making machinery reads the mRNA sequence and translates each three-base codon into it's corresponding amino acid in a growing protein chain.
- Transcription, as related to genomics, is the process of making an RNA copy of a gene’s DNA sequence.
- "mRNA is actually the translated form of DNA that the machinery can recognize and use to assemble amino acids into proteins" <br>

### 3. tRNA Definition
- tRNA is a small RNA molecule that plays a key role in protein synthesis. TRNA serves as a link (or adapter) between the mRNA molecule and the growing chain of amino acids that make up a protein. Each time an amino acid is added to the chain, a specific tRNA pairs with its complementary sequence on the mRNA molecule, ensuring that the appropriate amino acid is inserted into the protein being synthesized. <br>

- tRNA and mRNA relationship: A codon is a DNA or RNA sequence of three nucleotides (a trinucleotide) that forms a unit of genetic information encoding a particular amino acid. An anticodon is a trinucleotide sequence located at one end of a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, which is complementary to a corresponding codon in a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. Each time an amino acid is added to a growing polypeptide during protein synthesis, a tRNA anticodon pairs with its complementary codon on the mRNA molecule, ensuring that the appropriate amino acid is inserted into the polypeptide. <br>

### 4. mRNA Structure
- Within biological organisms, the structure of mRNA typically consists of several components, including the 5' end, the coding region, the 3' untranslated region, and the polyadenylate tail or Poly-A tail.
