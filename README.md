# RNA-3D-Folding-Prediction

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains my submissions and solutions for "RNA 3D Folding Prediction" data science and machine learning competition in Kaggle.

<br>

## ðŸ“Œ Competition Link:  [Stanford RNA 3D Folding](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-rna-3d-folding)
* **Description:** This project's main goal is to predict RNA molecule 3D structures from sequence data. In the competition, competitors will predict five 3D structures for each RNA sequence.
* **Results:** Pending.
